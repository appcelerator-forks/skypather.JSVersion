JavaScript feature detection in Titanium Mobile

Detects features of the Titanium's integrated JavaScript interpreter (Rhino, V8, or JavaScript Core) supports, not what your mobile device's browser (e.g. Mobile Safari) supports.

This app uses tests from @kangax's ECMAScript 5 compatibility table page (http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/) to detect which JavaScript features are supported by the Titanium JavaScript interpreter on your device. Note that these tests don't test full functionality or conformance with the ECMA-262 spec.
